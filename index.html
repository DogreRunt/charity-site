      <h2><img src="img/amyloidosis.png" alt="Official Logo"><br>About Amyloidosis</h2>
      <p>Bobby Black will forever be loved by his community. After his amyloidosis diagnosis, against all odds, he was blessed to have 8 additional years to shine, to smile,
        to make a difference. Amyloidosis is a rare disease, affecting less than 200,000 Americans with about 4,500 new cases each year.</p>
      <p>Amyloidosis is caused by a bone marrow disorder. The bone marrow in the center of bones produces cells in the blood system. These cells are the part of the
        immune system that makes antibodies for fighting infections. Proteins are also produced by the cells in the bone marrow.  In Amyloidosis patients, plasma cells
        produce an abnormal antibody protein. The misfolded amyloid proteins are deposited in and around tissues, nerves and organs. As the amyloid builds up in an organ,
        nerve or tissue, it gradually causes damage and affects their function. Each amyloidosis patient has a different pattern of amyloid deposition in their body. It often
        affects more than one organ and can last from several years to a lifetime and sadly, it took the life of our beloved teacher Mr. Black.</p>
